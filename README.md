# Solving-Linear-Advection-equation-with-two-discontinuities-in-IC
Solving the Linear-Advection equation with two discontinuities in initial condition using "upwind", "Lax", "Lax-Wendroff", "MacCormack" schemes.
The Advection equation is u_t + a*u_x = 0 and a=0.5 is wave speed.
Initial condition is u=0 for 0<=x<0.2 and u=1 for 0.2<=x<0.3 and u=0 for 0.3<=x<=1.
we solve this equation with one Drichlet B.C and above IC by Finite Differnce discretization.
